# Personality-Prediction-using-social-Media-Images


Personality prediction using social media images is a technique that uses computer algorithms and machine learning to analyze and interpret visual content posted on social media platforms. By analyzing visual cues such as facial expressions, body language, and other features in images, this technique can predict an individual's personality traits, such as extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. However, it's important to note that this approach has limitations and may not always be accurate or reliable.
